# Blockquotes

Keep blockquotes readable and consistently formatted.

## MD027 - Multiple spaces after blockquote symbol

Use a single space after the `>` marker.

Bad:

```markdown
>  Too many spaces
```

Good:

```markdown
> One space
```

## MD028 - Blank line inside blockquote

Avoid blank lines inside a blockquote unless the quote contains multiple
paragraphs.

Bad:

```markdown
> Line one
>
> Line two
```

Good:

```markdown
> Line one
> Line two
```
